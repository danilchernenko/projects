Task: Take as a basis the class hierarchy from the previous task 4.
The Car class has an engine attribute. The engine is an object of the Engine type. Create an Engine class, attributes as you wish. Proper methods must be present. The inputEngines.txt file contains information about the engines, each part on a separate line. Information between engines is separated by an empty line. The correctness of the information in the file is not guaranteed. The inputVehicles.txt file contains information about vehicles, each part on a separate line. Information between vehicles is separated by a blank line. The correctness of the information in the file is not guaranteed.
Create a Ferry class, add proper attributes (minimum 5). One of the attributes is vehicles. Add proper methods (constructor, getters and setters, equals, toString) with proper validation in constructor and setters. Write a program that reads information about engines and vehicles from files. Then the program works in the form of a menu and offers the following options:
- add a new vehicle
- remove the vehicle
- remove all vehicles
- display information about the vehicle on the screen
- display information about vehicles on the screen in the form of a table
- complete execution
To implement menu options, the Ferry class must have appropriate methods. Changed information about vehicles must be written to the corresponding file when the program is finished.
